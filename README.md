# Python Data Processing and Array Manipulation  

## Participant Names  
- **Participant 1:** [Omar Keita]  

- **Participant 2:** [Daniel Kudum]  

## Description  
This assignment involves debugging and completing the provided starter code to compute the sum of products for two matrices.  

## Tasks  
1. Debug the starter code to fix syntax and logical errors.  
2. Complete the missing logic in the for loop to calculate the dot product of the `Prices` matrix and the `Array2` list.  
3. Add comments explaining your solution.  

## Approach  
- The `Prices` matrix represents a list of costs.  
- The `Array2` list represents corresponding quantities.  
- Your task is to calculate the total cost for each row in `Prices` by multiplying each element in a row with its corresponding element in `Array2` and summing them up.  

### Example  
For the given `Prices` and `Array2`:
```python
Prices = [[300, 500],  
          [1000, 120.85]]  

Array2 = [200, 100]
